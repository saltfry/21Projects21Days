        "\n",
        "## Introduction\n",
        "This notebook explores the application of transfer learning using popular pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures to address the image classification task on the CIFAR-100 dataset. Leveraging models pre-trained on the large-scale ImageNet dataset, such as ResNet50, VGG16, and MobileNetV2, allows us to benefit from their learned feature extraction capabilities. The goal is to adapt these powerful models to the finer-grained classification challenges presented by CIFAR-100, which consists of 100 distinct classes. This approach significantly reduces the need for training deep models from scratch on a relatively smaller dataset, often leading to improved performance and faster convergence.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Project Flow\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load the CIFAR-100 dataset and apply the necessary preprocessing steps tailored for each pre-trained model (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2). This involves scaling pixel values and potentially resizing images to match the input requirements of the chosen architectures.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Model Preparation**:\n",
        "    *   Load pre-trained models (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2) without their top classification layers.\n",
        "    *   Add new custom classification layers suitable for the 100 classes of CIFAR-100.\n",
        "    *   Freeze the layers of the pre-trained base models to retain the learned features during initial training.\n",
        "    *   Compile the models with an appropriate optimizer, loss function, and metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Fine-Tuning and Training**:\n",
        "    *   Optionally unfreeze a portion of the top layers of the pre-trained models to allow for fine-tuning on the CIFAR-100 data.\n",
        "    *   Train the modified models on the preprocessed training data, monitoring performance on the validation set.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of each trained model (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2) on the held-out test dataset using relevant metrics such as accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Comparison of Results**: Compare the performance of the different models to understand the effectiveness of each architecture for transfer learning on CIFAR-100."

        "Q1: Which model performed best on the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset and why?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: ResNet50 generally performed the best (often hitting >80% quickly). I think this is because ResNet is \"deep but smart\"—the skip connections let it learn complex features without getting confused. VGG16 is massive and slow, and sometimes struggles to converge quickly with just a simple head attached. MobileNet is great for speed, but sometimes lacks the raw power for fine-grained differences between similar flowers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2: Compare the performance on Oxford Flowers 102 to CIFAR-100 (from the previous notebook). What differences do you observe?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The accuracy on Oxford Flowers is much higher than what we got on CIFAR-100 in the previous lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Why? CIFAR-100 images are tiny (32x32). Upscaling them to 224x224 (which these models need) makes them blurry and pixelated, so the pre-trained models struggle to \"see\" anything familiar.\n",
        "\n",
        "    Oxford Flowers images are naturally high resolution. When we resize them to 224x224, they still look like flowers. The pre-trained weights (trained on ImageNet) recognize petals and stems immediately, so transfer learning works way better here.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3: Discuss the effect of transfer learning on this dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        " Answer: Without transfer learning, we would be in trouble. The training split only has about 1,020 images for 102 classes (that's only 10 images per flower!). If we trained a CNN from scratch, it would memorize those 10 images instantly and fail on the test set (overfitting). Transfer learning brought in \"outside knowledge\" about shapes and edges, allowing us to get high accuracy despite the tiny training set.\n",

        "\n",
        "    Model-Specific Preprocessing: Used the functions provided by Keras (like resnet50.preprocess_input) to handle RGB scaling.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5: Challenges encountered?\n",
        "\n",
        "Answer: The main challenge was the memory management. Loading three copies of the dataset and three models crashed my RAM initially. I solved this by using the tf.data API properly (batching and prefetching) and not loading all images into a NumPy array at once."
